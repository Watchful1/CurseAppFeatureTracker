# Curse App Feature Tracker
This repo serves as an independent feature tracker for the [curse app](https://www.curse.com/). Except in special cases, this is not the appropriate place for bug reports.

The best way to both report bugs and request features remains the help screen in the curse app. This tracker is a good place to get feedback on ideas from the community before submitting them to curse, or for keeping track of and consolidating discussion on ones that have already been submitted.
