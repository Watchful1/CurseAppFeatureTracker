# Curse App Feature Tracker
This repo serves as an independent feature tracker for the [curse app](https://www.curse.com/). Except in special cases, this is not the appropriate place for bug reports.

The best way to both report bugs and request features remains the help screen in the curse app. This tracker is a good place to get feedback on ideas from the community before submitting them to curse, or for keeping track of and consolidating discussion on ones that have already been submitted.

Add a thumbs up to an issue if you think it's a good idea, a thumbs down if you don't. Feel free to comment on an issue if you want to add to the discussion, but please stick to the thumbs up and thumbs down if you don't have anything to say.
